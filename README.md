# Live Project
## Introduction

During the last two weeks of my time at the tech academy, I worked with fellow students to build an ASP.NET MVC web application for a local construction company using Entity Framework Code First.  When I entered the project it was a work in progress about a month away from delivery to the client.  At first it was overwhelming to look at a codebase I was unfarmiliar with but over the course of the project I became more and more comfortable with it.  The project was a great opportunity for me to learn new technologies on the fly and implement them in my code very rapidly.  I also had an opportunity to see how to communicate effectively with fellow programmers using project management software Azure DevOps and Slack.  This experience has given me the confidence that I posses the skills to be an effective junior developer that can work with a team to create high quality software.  Below are descriptions of some of the stories I worked on and the code implimentation as well.
